        <h1>History of FORTRAN</h1>

        <p>
            One of the oldest programming languages, the FORTRAN was developed by a team of programmers at IBM led by
            John Backus, and was first published in 1957. The name FORTRAN is an acronym for FORmula TRANslation,
            because it was designed to allow easy translation of math formulas into code.
            </br></br>

            Often referred to as a scientific language, FORTRAN was the first high-level language, using the first
            compiler ever developed. Prior to the development of FORTRAN computer programmers were required to program
            in machine/assembly code, which was an extremely difficult and time consuming task, not to mention the
            dreadful chore of debugging the code. The objective during it's design was to create a programming language
            that would be: simple to learn, suitable for a wide variety of applications, machine independent, and would
            allow complex mathematical expressions to be stated similarly to regular algebraic notation. While still
            being almost as efficient in execution as assembly language. Since FORTRAN was so much easier to code,
            programmers were able to write programs 500% faster than before, while execution efficiency was only reduced
            by 20%, this allowed them to focus more on the problem solving aspects of a problem, and less on coding.
            </br></br>

            FORTRAN was so innovative not only because it was the first high-level language, but also because of it's
            compiler, which is credited as giving rise to the branch of computer science now known as compiler theory.
            Several years after it's release FORTRAN had developed many different dialects, (due to special tweaking by
            programmers trying to make it better suit their personal needs) making it very difficult to transfer
            programs from one machine to another.
            </br></br>

            These problems lead the American Standards Association (now known as the American National Standards
            Association) to release it's first Standard for a Programming Languagein 1966. This first standardized
            version has come to be known as FORTRAN '66 (aka.. FORTRAN IV).
            </br></br>

            Despite this standardization, a few years later, various new dialects began to surface again, requiring the
            Standards Association review the language again. This version is known as FORTRAN '77. This version was
            released in 1978 (it was called '77 because the Association began it's review in 1977), with several new
            features. Some of the more notable properties were; new error handling methods, and mechanisms for managing
            large-scale programs. The latest version; Fortran '90 (released in 1990, using the new capitalization
            scheme) added even more new features, such as support for: recursion, pointers, and for programmer-defined
            data types.
            </br></br>

            {Fortran 90's future - Current research in compiler theory involves equipping compilers to generate object
            code, that is able to exploit the capabilities of massively parallel computers. Thr Fortran 90 compilers are
            key targets of such research}
